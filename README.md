Analyzing Brazilian Market Expansion Feasibility: Data Driven Businesses with SQL & Tableau

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Magist's database, using SQL and Tableau, to have an overview of the Brazilian market. 
Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in high tech products aims to expand into Brazil. We assess if Magist's marketplaces 
would be a good fit for Eniac's tech products. Based on the analysis, we provide recommendations to Eniac's board of directors 
regarding the potential partnership with Magist using the provided CSV files as data sources.
